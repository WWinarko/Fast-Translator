# Fast-Translator
COMP6841 (Extended Security Engineering and Cyber Security) Something Awesome Project. A Malicious Chrome Extension for Translating English to selected languanges. 

# How It Works

My Extension is able to Translate English to selected Languages (Chinese, Italian, Indonesian) by switching on the extension and select the language you want to translate to. Then select words you want to translate by highlight/drag/block them and it will automatically translated. I'm using the Translator API from Azure and embed a keylogger on the script. My keylogger connected to my firebase account and able to save user keyboard, mouse clicks, capture the user tabs and track the user location.
